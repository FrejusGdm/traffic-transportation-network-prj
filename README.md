# Network Final Project

## traffic-transportation-network-prj

## Introduction

This project aims to analyze the impact of significant events on traffic patterns, focusing primarily on road traffic but also considering air traffic where data is readily available. By simulating vehicle movement through transportation networks and introducing real-world rules, we seek to understand congestion patterns and propose strategies to improve traffic flow.

## Proposed Research Questions

### 1. Impact of Large Events on Traffic Data

#### a. **Taylor Swift's "Eras Tour" Concerts**

- **Air Traffic Impact**
  - Analyze flight patterns and volumes during concert dates.
  - Investigate changes in flight routes, surges in ticket prices, and origins of attendees.
- **Road Traffic Impact**
  - Utilize articles like [StreetLight Data's analysis](https://www.streetlightdata.com/taylor-swift-traffic-trends-eras-tour/) to generate synthetic road traffic data.
  - Examine increases in vehicle counts, congestion hotspots, and travel times around concert venues.

#### b. **Holiday Traffic Patterns**

- **Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's**
  - Assess the impact of major holidays on road traffic.
  - Identify critical choke points and propose strategies to alleviate congestion.
  - Explore methods to ensure timely arrivals for events like Thanksgiving dinners.

### 2. Infrastructure Testing

- **Impact of Adding Bike Lanes**
  - Evaluate how introducing bike lanes affects vehicle traffic flow and safety.
- **Converting Two-Way Streets to One-Way**
  - Analyze changes in traffic distribution and potential benefits or drawbacks.
- **Adding/Removing Traffic Lights**
  - Investigate the effects on intersection efficiency and overall traffic speeds.
- **Creating Dedicated Bus Lanes**
  - Assess improvements in public transportation efficiency and impacts on general traffic.

## New Ideas (Open for Discussion)

*--Let me know what you think Hamza--*

We can explore additional questions such as:

- **Impact of Weather Events on Traffic Networks**
  - Analyze how extreme weather conditions (e.g., snowstorms, heavy rain) disrupt traffic patterns.
- **Effect of Major Sporting Events on City Traffic**
  - Study congestion during events like the Super Bowl or World Cup matches.
- **Implementation of Adaptive Traffic Signal Systems**
  - Investigate how smart traffic lights can improve flow and reduce congestion.


## Objectives

- **Examine Congestion Patterns**
  - Understand how large events influence traffic flow.
- **Propose Routing or Network Modifications**
  - Develop strategies to reduce bottlenecks and improve efficiency.
- **Simulate Real-World Scenarios**
  - Introduce elements like traffic signals, one-way streets, and road closures.

## Metrics for Evaluation

(Will prolly be cahnged later)

- **Average Travel Time**
- **Congestion Levels**
- **Impact of Interventions**

## Data Generation and Sources

- **Synthetic Data Creation**
  - Generate data that aligns with known traffic impact figures from studies.
- **Publicly Available Data**
  - Utilize accessible air and road traffic data where possible.

## Extension Possibilities

- **Adaptive Routing Strategies**
  - Test how real-time data can inform route choices during disruptions.
- **Scenario Testing**
  - Simulate road closures, accidents, or sudden weather changes.

## Conclusion

This project offers a platform to explore how significant events impact transportation networks and to develop practical solutions for congestion management. Collaboration and the incorporation of diverse ideas will enhance the depth and applicability of our findings.
